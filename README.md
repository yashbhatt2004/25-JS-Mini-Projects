# 25-JS-Mini-Projects
A collection of 25 mini-projects built with Vanilla JavaScript, designed to strengthen core JavaScript skills and improve problem-solving abilities.

## Introduction
This repository contains a series of 25 small projects using Vanilla JavaScript. Each project is built to explore and solidify various JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, asynchronous operations, and more.This repository serves as a personal journey toward deepening my understanding of Vanilla JavaScriptâ€”pure JavaScript without any libraries or frameworks like React, Angular, or jQuery.

In a world where modern web development often leans on powerful frameworks, it's easy to overlook the fundamental building blocks that make those frameworks possible. Vanilla JavaScript provides the essential skills needed to fully understand how browsers interact with code, how the DOM is manipulated, and how to handle user interactions and data in a clean, efficient way.

## Goals
<ul>
<li>Strengthen JavaScript fundamentals.</li>
<li>Practice DOM manipulation, event listeners, and various other JS features.</li>
<li>Build practical and fun mini-projects that can be used as learning tools or for real-world problem solving.</li>
<li>Avoid the use of external libraries or frameworks (No jQuery, React, etc.).</li>
</ul>

## Projects
Below is a list of the 25 projects that will be included in this repository:

Project 1: **CSS+JS Clock**

## Getting Started
You can either clone the entire repository or clone individual projects based on your interest. Follow the steps below:
1. **Clone the repository**
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/25-vanilla-js-projects.git
```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**
```bash
cd 25-vanilla-js-projects/project-name
```
3. **Open the Project in Your Browser:**
```perl
file:///path/to/drum-kit-project/index.html
```
If you prefer to work on or review a single project, you can clone only that specific project's directory

## About the Developer
This project was developed by Yash Bhatt, a passionate developer currently diving into Back-End Development while also exploring Python's data science and ML libraries.Each project reflects a hands-on approach to mastering JavaScript, and while they showcase core concepts, Yash sees them as an ongoing learning experience. He encourages fellow developers to share insights, ideas, and improvements to collaboratively grow and refine these projects.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add improvements or new features to any of the projects, feel free to open a pull request.
