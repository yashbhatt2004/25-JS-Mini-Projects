# CSS+JS Analog Clock
Welcome to the CSS+JS Analog Clock project! This project demonstrates how to create a fully functional analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a visually appealing clock with AM/PM meridiem indicators and a TimeLapse button to toggle between 12-hour and 24-hour formats.

## Features
* **Analog Clock**: The analog clock will display the current time with hour, minute, and second hands. The time updates in real-time.
* **Meridiem Indicator**: The AM/PM indicator at the bottom of the clock adjusts automatically to display whether the time is in the morning (AM) or afternoon (PM).
* **TimeLapse Button**: Click the TimeLapse button to speed up or slow down the clock.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashbhatt2004/css-js-analog-clock.git
```

**Download Project Files**: Alternatively, download the project files directly from the repository.

2. **Open the Project**: Navigate to the project folder and open the index.html file in your web browser.
```perl
file:///path/to/drum-kit-project/index.html
```

## File Structure
The project directory contains the following files:

* index.html: The main HTML file that provides the structure of the clock.
* styles.css: The CSS file for styling the clock and its components.
* scripts.js: The JavaScript file responsible for the clock's functionality and interaction.

## Potential Enhancements
* **Stopwatch**: A feature that can be added to track elapsed time for specific events.
* **Timer**: An option to count down from a set amount of time and trigger an alarm or visual indication when the time is up.
* **Clock Numbers**: Add numbers (1â€“12) along the clock face to provide a more traditional analog clock appearance.
