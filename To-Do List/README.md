# To-Do List Application
This is a To-Do List web application that allows users to manage their tasks by categorizing them into pending and completed sections. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as complete, move completed tasks back to pending, and delete tasks from either list. The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different device sizes.

## Features
* Add New Tasks: Easily add new tasks to the pending list.
* Mark Tasks as Completed: Once a task is finished, it can be moved to the completed list.
* Move Tasks Back to Pending: If needed, tasks can be moved back from completed to pending.
* Delete Tasks: Tasks can be deleted from both pending and completed lists.
* Responsive Design: The app is designed to work smoothly on desktops, tablets, and mobile   devices.

## Future Features
* Task Editing: The ability to edit task descriptions after they have been added.

* Due Dates: Set due dates for tasks and receive notifications for upcoming deadlines.
* Drag and Drop: Implement drag-and-drop functionality to easily reorder tasks or move them between pending and completed.
* Data Persistence: Save tasks using local storage or integrate a back-end database to persist tasks between sessions.
