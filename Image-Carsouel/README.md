# Image Carousel
The Image Carousel is a dynamic, responsive component that cycles through a set of images, providing a visually appealing slideshow experience. Built with CSS for styling and animations, and JavaScript for controlling the functionality, this carousel allows users to manually navigate between images or let them transition automatically at a set interval.

## Features
* **Responsive Design**: The carousel is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
* **Looping**: Once the last image is reached, the carousel loops back to the first image seamlessly.
* **Automatic Slide Transition**:Images will automatically slide every few seconds (configurable through JavaScript).

* **Manual Navigation**: Click the "Next" button to move to the next image, or the "Previous" button to go back to the previous image.
